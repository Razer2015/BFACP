[![Download Battlefield Admin Control Panel](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bfacp/files/latest/download)

Download the latest version. Once downloaded unzip it to a temporary folder on your computer. Next open the `.env.example` file located in the root folder in your favorite text editor. Scroll down to the database settings section and fill in your database connection information.

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=homestead
DB_USERNAME=homestead
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

Next we need to create a encryption key. This is **IMPORTANT**! The default key provided is just a placeholder string and is insecure. I have provided a page where you can get a random 32 character string. I do **NOT** save these and they are random on each refresh. You can access this page [here](https://adkats.gamerethos.net/api/random_key). Now go back to the `.env.example` file and replace the `SomeRandomString` with the key that was generated. By default it will look like this.

```
APP_KEY=SomeRandomString
```

## Pusher Configuration (Optional)

If you would like to have real-time online users & site chat, you will to create an account over at [Pusher](https://pusher.com/signup). Once you have your account and are logged in click on the "Your apps" tab on the left and click the button that says "Create new app". Now for the app name you can name it whatever you want, I just used my communities name. For the cluster selection choose the one that's the closest to your web server, if you know it, otherwise the default they provide is fine. After that click "Create my app" button.

You should now see your newly created app. Now click on the "App keys" tab. Copy the credentials to the approate field in the `.env.example` file.

```
PUSHER_APP_ID=null
PUSHER_KEY=null
PUSHER_SECRET=null
```

Once completed, save the file in the same location as `.env.example` and name it `.env`, then upload the entire application to your webserver. Once uploaded you will need to modify some file and folder permissions. Change the files and folders permissions under `storage` recursively to 0777. This includes the storage folder itself. Also do this for the `builds` folder located at `public/js/builds`

## Note
This application was designed to run on a subdomain and not from a folder from the TLD. Make sure to create a subdomain and if possible have domain point to the `public` folder that's located under the root folder. Not a redirect.

Now load up application in your web browser and it will begin the process of creating the tables. This process will take a few seconds to run on first load. When it completed you should see the dashboard.

## Default login

**Username**: admin

**Password**: password

You can change the default username and password by clicking on **Site Management** > **Users** > **Admin**

If you have any questions or need help setting this up please post it [here](http://www.adkgamers.com/forum/265-adk-web-dev-support/).

## Installing from the command line

This method is only for those who have shell access to their web server or VPS. This will download and extract the files to your current directory. Make sure it's an empty directory.

If you have git installed you can just run the following command to install it. You must have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) and php command line installed.

### Composer Method (preferred)

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist --no-scripts --keep-vcs adkgamers/bfadmincp .
```

### Git Method

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prophet731/BFAdminCP.git .
composer install --no-scripts
```

This will clone and install the dependency's need for the BFACP to work. This will checkout the master branch which is the stable version. If you would like to run the develop version you will need to run `git checkout develop` before you issue the composer command.

To update it all you will need to do is run `git pull` and it will pull the latest version on the current branch (master or develop).

To make this an automated process you can create a cron job for it.

```bash
* * * * * cd /path/to/bfacp; git pull >/dev/null 2>&1
```

### Installing Dev Version

I will assume you already have a webspace setup for this. If not just follow directions above to get the basics setup then come back here. All you should need to do is follow the commands and you should be up and running.

Make sure the directory is empty.
```bash
cd /path/to/bfacp
git clone https://github.com/Prophet731/BFAdminCP.git .
git checkout dev-laravel5
composer install --no-scripts
chmod -R 0777 storage
chmod -R 0777 public/js/builds
cp .env.example .env
```

After you ran those command edit the file `.env` with the necessary information then save the file. Next enter these commands.

```bash
php artisan migrate --force
php artisan db:seed --force
```

If you were running a previous version then you will need to run this command as well.
```bash
php artisan bfacp:reseed
```

You should be good to go now. Make sure that you update the subdomain to point to the `public` folder for its directory (not a redirect). If you wish to update to the latest version of this branch just do a `git pull`.

## Docker guide

### Installation

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) ;

2. Copy `docker-compose.yml` file to your project root path, and edit it according to your needs ;

3. From your project directory, start up your application by running:

```sh
docker-compose up
```
4. If you want, you can run composer or artisan through docker. For instance:

```sh
docker-compose exec php composer install --no-scripts
docker-compose exec php php artisan migrate
```

5. Assign roles

If you are updating from a version that didn't have **bfacp_user_role** table. You'll now be greeted with the **Undefined offset: 0** error after login. It's because the new roles table doesn't have any roles assigned for your user.

Go and edit the **bfacp_user_role** database manually and assign a role for yourself.

After you have done that, you can assign other user roles from the panel.

6. Permissions
```bash
cd /path/to/bfacp
chmod -R 0777 storage
chmod -R 0777 public/js/builds
```

7. Add permissions for chat

```sql
-- Insert missing permissions when updating from below 2.1 version
INSERT IGNORE INTO `bfacp_permissions` (`id`, `name`, `display_name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) VALUES
  (39, 'admin.site.pusher.users.view', 'Allowed to see online users', NOW(), NOW()),
  (40, 'admin.site.pusher.chat.view', 'Allowed to see site chat', NOW(), NOW()),
  (41, 'admin.site.pusher.chat.talk', 'Allowed to send messages on site chat', NOW(), NOW());

-- Link missing permissions to administrator when updating from below 2.1 version
INSERT INTO `bfacp_permission_role` (`permission_id`, `role_id`) 
SELECT 39, 1 FROM DUAL 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM `bfacp_permission_role` 
      WHERE `permission_id` = 39 AND `role_id` = 1 LIMIT 1);
      
INSERT INTO `bfacp_permission_role` (`permission_id`, `role_id`) 
SELECT 40, 1 FROM DUAL 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM `bfacp_permission_role` 
      WHERE `permission_id` = 40 AND `role_id` = 1 LIMIT 1);
      
INSERT INTO `bfacp_permission_role` (`permission_id`, `role_id`) 
SELECT 41, 1 FROM DUAL 
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM `bfacp_permission_role` 
      WHERE `permission_id` = 41 AND `role_id` = 1 LIMIT 1);

-- Assign roles again (because roles table has changed)
INSERT IGNORE INTO bfacp_user_role (user_id, role_id)
SELECT user_id, role_id
FROM bfacp_assigned_roles
```
